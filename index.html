        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi there, my name is Isabel Pi Pliego. I am a first-year student at the University of California-Riverside studying business and hoping to have a career in the marketing field. I am originally from the Los Angeles area. In high school I was involved in link crew a group that helps freshman make the transition from middle school to high school. My duties as a link crew member included giving tours of the school, giving freshman advice, and making myself available in case any freshman had questions. I was also involved in the interact club which was a volunteering organization. My junior and senior year is when I went to Monrovia high school. For my freshman and sophomore years I attended St. Lucyâ€™s Priory High School in Glendora, California which was about 40 mins away from Los Angeles. While I was there, I was involved in the St. Lucyâ€™s musical both years. I was also involved with Kiwins a service-based club my freshman and sophomore year. My sophomore year I was involved with the St. Lucyâ€™s Chamber singers. We would perform at church and other events such as fundraisers. <br><br>

        My junior year of high school I had my first two jobs. In January of 2019 I started working at a Kumon which is a place that specializes in advancing kids in math and reading. I started there as a corrector where I would just correct and collect the assignments from the students. After a few months I became an Early Learning assistant. My duties include working with young kids between the ages of 3 and 8 to give them a foundation in math and reading. This job helped me to the unique needs of each child which meant I needed to learn how to best tailor the work to each child to make sure they could complete their assignments and learn. My other main function at Kumon is being a front desk person. Typically, I take students temperatures, tell them were to go and also answer any questions that students or parents may have. My other job which I also started in January 2019 is being an office assistant for RMD Financial services an accounting firm in Monrovia, California. I sort and organize files and also respond to emails and help fill out expense forms and budget forms. <br><br>

        Here at UCR I am involved in several organizations such as my sorority Delta Gamma. Being in Delta Gamma has taught me a lot about being a strong woman in a collaborative community. Within Delta Gamma I am involved in the programming committee where I work with the Vice President and two other women to plan some of our events such as sisterhoods (events where the sister can get to know each other better) and retreats (self-care days for our sisters).  I am also involved in The womenâ€™s network here at UCR. It is an organization that is dedicated to help women succeed in the work force especially in places where it can be heavily dominated by men.
